For your supermarket billing system project in C++, 
you developed a system that allows users to select items for purchase.
The system handles item selection, price calculation, and generates the total bill. 
It simulates real-world supermarket operations with features like item listing,
quantity selection, and automated bill generation. 
The project emphasizes object-oriented programming and efficient data handling.
